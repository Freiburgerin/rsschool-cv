### More information
As I gained 5 years of work experience in Germany and Belarus as project engineer I have developed such skills as attention to details, scrupulousness, learned to make independent decisions in difficult situations and developed flexibility. Working on budget offers I balanced between client budget and our possibilities and was able to find an appropriate technical solutions to fulfill the requirements. Representing my company in exhibitions hepled me to overcome inner diffidence. Working in teams on different wastewater treatment projects taught me to adjust to working style of my colleagues, to stick to project schedules and find solutions in short time.

My motto is "Never stop learning". I decided to take online-course on front-end, as I consider programming to be one of the integral parts of our future. Being able to complete an online course is a test of a student's motivation and drive, so I believe it's a good opportunity for me to develop myself and strengthen my skills. I believe that completing this course I will be able to create functional websites and probably switch my career path.
